## Description

My motivation for doing this project was to learn relevant stack-technologies while at the same time creating something that interest me.
The result is this training-website that lets you plan workouts and write comments on each workout before or after they have been done.
You can aslo "check" after they have been done to keep track in your progression.

This project is not yet complete. I would like to also have a registration possibility so that each user can have their own plan.
But i still want to publish it to show of what i have learnt.

The technologies used in this project includes: 
* React frontend
* Javascript backend
* Redux UI
* Node and express Server

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Should have Node installed

### Executing program

* Navigate to cd server

```

```

## Help

One typical problem is that the workouts doesnt show up,
and the display shows "ingenting".
This usually solves after refreshing a couple of times.
